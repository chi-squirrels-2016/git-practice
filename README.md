# READ THIS FIRST

What is this?  We are just using this to practice some branching and merging stuff.

Branching and merging is hard.  So let's all make a branch and change something in the existing text in any of the files in this repo.

Hopefully you will gain a better understanding of better ![sudoku](https://github.com/tomorrow-lauren/lauren-doodle/blob/master/jpg/sabri.jpg)workflow after doing this practice.

Add weird text anywhere in these files.  In the middle of this sentence.  In the middle of a paragraph.  It's less painful if you just stick something at the end. The point is to force some painful merge conflicts!!!
