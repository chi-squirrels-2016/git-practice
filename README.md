# READ THIS FIRST

What is this?  Really this is nothing.  We are just using this to practice some branching and merging stuff.

Branching and merging is hard.  Right?  So let's all make a branch and change something in the existing text in any of the files in this repo.

Hopefully this will help you gain a better understanding of better workflow after doing this practice.

Add weird text anywhere in these files. In the middle of this sentence.  In the middle of a paragraph.  It's less painful if you just stick something at the end. The point is to force some painful merge conflicts!!!
