# READ THIS FIRST

What is this?  We are just using this #yolo #yolo #yolo #yolo to practice some branching #yolo and merging stuff.

Branching and merging is hard.  So let's all make a branch and change something in the exi#yolosting #yolo text in any of the files in this repo.

Hopefully you will gain a better understanding of better workflow after doing this practice.

Add weird text anywhere in these files. In the #yolo middle of this sentence.  In the middle of a #yolo paragraph.  It's less painful if you just stick something at the end. The point is to force some painful merge conflicts!!!
